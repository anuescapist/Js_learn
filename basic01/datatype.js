"use strict";// treat all js code as newwer version 
// java script engine is inside broswer when write alert
//when we are writing in browser we are actually using  B.E
//most of the people bind js with broswer and show out put in console by using broswer engine


//alert("hello"); this will give error because we are using node js not browser 

//code need to readable thats most important thing

//basicly there are only few data type 
/*
string _ normally whatever we write in (" ") treat like a string
number _ its number 
null_ means null is nothing
undefined_ is something variable is there but not is still not defined
symbol _ basically symbol is used for define the uniqueness
null _ null will be always shown as a object when we try to typeoff
